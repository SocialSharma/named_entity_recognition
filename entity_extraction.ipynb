    "For our conversational academic paper program, we won't be satisfied with simply capturing named entities, because we need to understand the relationships between general concepts as well as actual things, places, etc. Unfortunately, while most out-of-the-box text processing libraries have a moderately useful <strong>named entity recognizer</strong>, they have little to no support for a generalized <strong>entity recognizer</strong>. \n",

    "This is because of a subtle, yet important constraint. \n",

    "Entities, as we've discussed, correspond to a superset of named entities, which <strong><em>should</em></strong> make them easier to extract. Indeed, blindly pulling all entities from a text source is in fact simple, but it's sadly not all that useful. In order to justify this exercise, we'd need to develop an entity extraction approach that is restricted to, or is cognizant of, some particular domain, for example, neuroscience, psychology, computer science, economics, etc. This paradoxical complexity makes it nontrivial to create a generic, but useful, entity recognizer. Hence the lack of support in most open-source libraries that deal with natural language processing. \n",
    "\n",
    "To largely simplify our task then, we must generate a set of entities from a scientific paper, that is <strong><em>larger</em></strong> than a simple list of named entities, but <strong><em>smaller</em></strong> than the giant list of all entities, restricted to the domain of a particular paper in question. \n",
    "\n",
    "Yikes. Are you sweating a little? Because I am. Instead of reaching for some Ibuprofen and deep learning pills, let's make a prototype using a little ingenuity, simple open-source code, and a lot of heuristics. Hopefully, through this process, we'll also learn a bit about the text processing pipeline that brings understanding natural language into the realm of the possible. "

But then again, this is exactly why simply extracting named entities is not enough. On the plus side, our intuition about built-in models and scientific text was spot on! The spaCy named entity recognizer just wasn't exposed to this category of corpora and was instead trained on [blogs, news, and comments](https://spacy.io/models/en#en_core_web_lg). Academic papers don't use the most common English words, so it isn't unreasonable to expect a generally trained model to fail when confronted with text in such a restricted domain.   \n",

The <strong>noun phrase</strong> or <strong>chunk</strong> is an abstraction which consists of two or more words, and is the by-product of dependency parsing, POS tagging, and tokenization. spaCy's POS tagger is essentially a statistical model which learns to predict the tag (noun, verb, adjective, etc.) for a given word using examples of tagged-sentences. \n",

    "These last four functions will slice and dice the list of entities gathered from each abstract in various ways.

    "Well, in NLP, as in search engine optimization (SEO), the most common words in a given corpus are known as [stop words](https://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/html/htmledition/dropping-common-terms-stop-words-1.html). These unfortunate candidates are hunted down with extreme prejudice and removed from the population to improve search results, enhance semantic analysis, and in our case, help restrict the domain. This is because removing stop words automatically limits the vocabulary of a corpus to the words that are less frequent and therefore, more likely to exist in that abstract than anywhere else. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can, of course, argue that the most common words in a scientific paper might in fact be the most important concepts, but stop words are usually overwhelmingingly overrepresented in any corpus. This intuition however, is exactly why we aren't going to simply take the most common words in one specific abstract and remove them. Instead, we'll be targetting the most frequent words based on a large, general domain sample of the English language. \n",
