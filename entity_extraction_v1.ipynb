Once you establish the efficacy of a low-cost, easy approach, you can then put on your Elon Musk hat and drive towards into #innovation and #disruption. \n",

    "spaCy has a wonderful set of classes and methods defined to help visualize parts of the NLP processing pipeline. Up top, where we've imported modules, you'll have noticed that I'm pulling 'EntityRenderer' from spaCy's displacy module, as we'll be repurposing some of this code for our... um... purposes. In general, this is a good exercise if you ever want to get your hands dirty and really learn how certain classes work in your friendly neighborhood open source projects. Nothing should ever be taboo or a black-box; always dissect and play with your code before you eat it.  \n",

Well, one of my biggest pet peeves is this: even if you can create a product, if you don't put in the time to make it look beautiful or delightful to use, then you don't care about packaging your ideas for export to an audience. And that makes me sad. Once you get something working, make it pretty. <strong>&lt;/rant&gt;</strong></em>"

To address this fundamental challenge in crowdsourcing, we propose a simple payment mechanism to incentivize workers to answer only the questions that they are sure of and skip the rest.

We also show that among all possible incentive-compatible  mechanisms (that may or may not satisfy no-free-lunch), our mechanism makes the smallest possible payment to spammers.
