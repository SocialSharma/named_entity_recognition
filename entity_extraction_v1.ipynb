    "For our conversational academic paper program, we won't be satisfied with simply capturing named entities, because we need to understand the relationships between general concepts as well as actual things, places, etc. Unfortunately, while most out-of-the-box text processing libraries have a moderately useful <strong>named entity recognizer</strong>, they have little to no support for a generalized <strong>entity recognizer</strong>. \n",

    "This is because of a subtle, yet important constraint. \n",
    "\n",
    "Entities, as we've discussed, correspond to a superset of named entities, which <strong><em>should</em></strong> make them easier to extract. Indeed, blindly pulling all entities from a text source is in fact simple, but it's sadly not all that useful. In order to justify this exercise, we'd need to develop an entity extraction approach that is restricted to, or is cognizant of, some particular domain, for example, neuroscience, psychology, computer science, economics, etc. This paradoxical complexity makes it nontrivial to create a generic, but useful, entity recognizer. Hence the lack of support in most open-source libraries that deal with natural language processing. \n",
    "\n",
    "To largely simplify our task then, we must generate a set of entities from a scientific paper, that is <strong><em>larger</em></strong> than a simple list of named entities, but <strong><em>smaller</em></strong> than the giant list of all entities, restricted to the domain of a particular paper in question. \n",
    "\n",
    "Yikes. Are you sweating a little? Because I am. Instead reaching for some Ibuprofen and deep learning pills, let's make a prototype using a little ingenuity, simple open-source code, and a lot of heuristics. Hopefully, through this process, we'll also learn a bit about the text processing pipeline that brings understanding natural language into the realm of the possible. "

In general, this is a good exercise if you ever want to get your hands dirty and really learn how certain classes work in your friendly neighborhood open-source projects.

But then again, this is exactly why simply extracting named entities is not enough. On the plus side, our intuition about built-in models and scientific text was spot on! The spaCy named entity recognizer just wasn't exposed to this category of corpora and was instead trained on [blogs, news, and comments](https://spacy.io/models/en#en_core_web_lg). Academic papers don't use the most common English words, so it isn't unreasonable to expect a generally trained model to fail when confronted with text in such a restricted domain.   \n",

The <strong>noun phrase</strong> is one such abstraction, consists of two or more words, and is the by-product of dependency parsing, POS tagging, and tokenization. spaCy's POS tagger is essentially a statistical model which learns to predict the tag (noun, verb, adjective, etc.) for a given word using examples of tagged-sentences. \n",

    "Now that we have all the entities grouped together, we can see how good we are doing. We've successfully captured single-word as well as n-gram entities, but there do seem to be a lot of duplicates and words that should be a part of a phrase, but were somehow split apart, probably as a result of not dealing with hyphenation properly when we first tokenized our abstracts. This should be relatively easy to take care of now. We'll also apply a few other heuristics to clean up our list. "
